  The HTML   tag is used to group the large section of HTML elements together.

We know that every tag has a specific purpose e.g. p tag is used to specify paragraph,   tag are used to specify headings but the   tag is just like a container unit which is used to encapsulate other page elements and divides the HTML documents into sections.

The div tag is generally used by web developers to group HTML elements together and apply CSS styles to many elements at once. For example: If you wrap a set of paragraph elements into a div element so you can take the advantage of CSS styles and apply font style to all paragraphs at once instead of coding the same style for each paragraph element.
